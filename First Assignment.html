    <p>Once upon a younger year
        When all our shadows disappeared
        The animals inside came out to play
        Went face to face with all our fears <!--here we can also put Paragraph tab to add other new paragraph -->
        Learned our lessons through the tears
        Made memories we knew would never fade
        One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
        He took me in his arms, I heard him say
        "When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
    </P>
    <P> <!-- this is second paragraph-->
        Think of me if ever you're afraid"
        He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
        So live a life you will remember"
        My father told me when I was just a child
        "These are the nights that never die"
        My father told me
        "When thunderclouds start pouring down
        Light a fire
        they can't put out
        Carve your name into those shining stars"
        He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
        Don't forsake this life of yours
        I'll guide you home no matter where you are"
        One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
        When I was just a kid, I heard him say
        "When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
        Think of me if ever you're afraid"
    </P>
    <P> <!--this is third para of song-->
        He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
        So live a life you will remember"
        My father told me when I was just a child
        "These are the nights that never die"
        My father told me
        "These are the nights that never die"
        My father told me
        My father told me
